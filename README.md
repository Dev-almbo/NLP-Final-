# NLP-Final

This project is the final project for the course "Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing". 
It was written in a group together with A. Akkaya. 

This repository contains the methodology to a paper that seeks to provide insight for the landlords as well as the customers for Airbnb using an
extensive review data for Copenhagen listings. First, LDA topic modelling and word2vec clustering
techniques were employed. Furthermore, text summarization was employed in order to summarize reviews for each listing, which
may reach above 100 and makes it time consuming and confusing for the customer to read.
